# Agents Guide: Delayed Queue for Java

This is the **Kotlin/Java implementation** of the Delayed Queue for Java developers.
All public APIs must look and feel like a Java library. The `kotlin-java-library`
skill is the rule of law for any public surface changes.

## Non-negotiable rules
- Public API is Java-first: no Kotlin-only surface features or Kotlin stdlib types.
- Keep nullability explicit and stable; avoid platform types in public signatures.
- Do not change or remove published public members; add overloads instead.
- Use JVM interop annotations deliberately to shape Java call sites.
- Verify every public entry point with a Java call-site example.
- Agents MUST practice TDD: write the failing test first, then implement the change.
- Library dependencies should never be added by agents, unless instructed to do so.

## Public API constraints (Java consumers)
- Use Java types in signatures: `java.util.List/Map/Set`, `java.time.*`,
  `java.util.concurrent.*`, `java.util.Optional`, `java.io.*`.
- Avoid Kotlin types in public API: `kotlin.collections.*`, `kotlin.Result`,
  `kotlin.Unit`, `kotlin.Pair/Triple`, `kotlin.time.*`, `kotlinx.*`.
- Avoid default arguments without `@JvmOverloads` or explicit overloads.
- Avoid extension-only entry points; expose top-level or static members.
- Use `@Throws` for checked exceptions expected by Java callers.
- Return defensive copies or unmodifiable views for collections.

## JVM interop patterns
- `@JvmOverloads` for stable default arguments; prefer explicit overloads when
  behavior differs between overloads.
- `@JvmStatic` on companion/object functions that should be `static` in Java.
- `@JvmField` only for true constants or immutable fields.
- `@JvmName` to avoid signature clashes or provide stable Java names.
- `@file:JvmName` for top-level utilities, optionally `@file:JvmMultifileClass`.

## Binary compatibility
- Declare explicit public return types; avoid inferred public signatures.
- Do not change types, nullability, or parameter order of public members.
- Add new overloads instead of changing existing ones.
- Use a deprecation cycle before removal.

## Code style / best practices

- NEVER catch `Throwable`, you're only allowed to catch `Exception`
- Use nice imports instead of fully qualified names
- NEVER use default parameters for database-specific behavior (filters, adapters, etc.) - these MUST match the actual driver/config
- Exception handling must be PRECISE - only catch what you intend to handle. Generic catches like `catch (e: SQLException)` are almost always wrong.
  - Use exception filters/matchers for specific error types (DuplicateKey, TransientFailure, etc.)
  - Let unexpected exceptions propagate to retry logic

## Testing

- Practice TDD: write tests before the implementation.
- Projects strives for full test coverage. Tests have to be clean and easy to read.
- **All tests for public API go into `./src/test/java`, built in Java.**
  - If a test calls public methods on `DelayedQueue`, `CronService`, or other public interfaces → Java test
  - This ensures the Java API is tested from a Java consumer's perspective
- **All tests for internal implementation go into `./src/test/kotlin`, built in Kotlin.**
  - If a test is for internal classes/functions (e.g., `SqlExceptionFilters`, `Raise`, retry logic) → Kotlin test

## Review checklist
- Java call sites compile for all public constructors and methods.
- No Kotlin stdlib types exposed in public signatures.
- Default args are covered by overloads for Java.
- Exceptions are declared with `@Throws` where relevant.
- Tests targeting the public API should be Java tests.
